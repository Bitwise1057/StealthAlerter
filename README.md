Stealth Alerter detects if someone near you uses a stealth ability, and logs a message in your chat window. I originally wrote this AddOn in 2009, because a very annoying Rogue named √ùes used to hang out in Wintergrasp on the Shu'halo server where people were fishing. I've also found it useful in raids, battlegrounds and arenas.

The following actions are detected:
* Camouflage (Hunter)
* Draenic Invisibility Potion and Commander's Draenic Invisibility Potion
* Greater Invisibility (Mage)
* Invisibility (Mage)
* Invisibility Potion
* Lesser Invisibility Potion
* Potion of  the Hidden Spirit
* Potion of the Hushed Zephyr
* Potion of Trivial Invisibility
* Prowl (Druid)
* Shadowmeld (Night Elf)
* Shroud of Concealment (Rogue)
* Stealthman 54
* Stealth (Rogue)
* Vanish (Rogue)

`/sal on` enables Stealth Alerter and `/sal off` disables it. `/sal` while enabled lists all options and settings.
